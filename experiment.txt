My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.

Ingredient Checklist
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2  eggs
1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed
1 cup olive oil for frying
½ cup prepared tomato sauce
¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
¼ cup chopped fresh basil
½ cup grated provolone cheese
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil
Directions
Instructions Checklist
Step 1
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Step 2
Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
Step 4
Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.
Step 5
Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.
Step 6
Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes.
Step 7
Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
Step 8
Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Step 9
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Cook's Note:
Use high-quality prepared tomato sauce for a better end result. You may substitute pesto or dried Italian herbs of your choice for basil, or omit entirely. If using fresh mozzarella, cut it into cubes instead of shredding it.           Partner Tip
Reynolds® Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.

I use a little more flavorful breading 1cup of panko 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs and a cup of parmesan cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley a teaspoon of fresh chopped Thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I brown the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. I also cook some angel hair while the chicken is browning and put it under the chicken in a casserole dish cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes remove foil add cheese and bake another 10 minutes

3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to 'eye this up' and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not 'fresh' for best melting result. #6- Don't put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now, with these changes, the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan.

Have to admit if it's not easy and/or tasty I won't put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this and every recipe gets easier each time its' made right? I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn't use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great! Given that I had twice as many fillets next time I would probably use half the oil so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.) As much as I loved this recipe given the calories/fat I would not make it as often as I'd like. 10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it's not as crispy I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk then cut trim and pound with mallet before freezing for later use this saves lots of time during actual recipe.

Some time ago, I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above, after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2, lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides.
I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc.  It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well.

All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site, but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won't hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!

Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests. For those folks cooking in high altitude 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts. You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving. Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long the cheese might burn.

I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor and your food is excellent! (swoon...get me the fainting couch!)
